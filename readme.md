This code is a work in progress!

For use with interbotix arms running the ArmLinkSerial Sketch

This code uses Darius Morawiec's leap motion library

I've included a version in this repo as I haven't had time to test out newer versions.

Make sure the contents of the 'libraries' folder go into your 'libraries' folder in your 'Processing' folder.

Tested with processing 2.2
